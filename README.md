# odin-recipes
This project is named, odin-recipes. As the name suggests I'll be making a basic website which will give you instructions in making various recipes. The technology used in this project will only be HTML for now, since I'm only familiar with html at the moment.
Because of the limited involvement of technology, the project will not look at all beautiful, it'll be a mess of text, lists, links, and images.
We'll update the website to better style it after we learn CSS in the upcoming curriculum.
